Source Owl generates a PDF file, from specific file extensions, in one text file.
It scans a folder for specific file extensions, and outputs a one huge file as .txt

Usage:
1- enter the data in the config file
2- run this command
  python3 generate.py

To Do List
1- generate a pdf, not a txt file
2- simple summary of the source code, number of files, and number of lines
3- ability to add a cover page.

Temporary Notes:
  1) if you want the file as a pdf file, you can print the file as a pdf on mac, just print the txt file, choose save as pdf.
  2) if you want syntax highlighting, open the file with your IDE, and print as PDF from the IDE itself.

Contributions are welcome.
