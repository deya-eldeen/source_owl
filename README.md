# Source To PDF

your boss asked you for the source code as a pdf file? this tool can generate one...

a simple tool (written in 15 minutes) to scan a folder for specific file extensions, and outputs a one huge file as .txt

usage:
enter the data in the config file
python3 generate.py

Notes:
  1) if you want the file as a pdf file, you can print the file as a pdf on mac, just print the txt file, choose save as pdf.
  2) if you want syntax highlighting, open the file with your IDE, and print as PDF from the IDE itself.

Contributions are welcome.
